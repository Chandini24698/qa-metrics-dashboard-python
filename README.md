## 📊 Key Features

- 📌 Failures by Module  
- 📌 Priority Distribution of Failed Test Cases  
- 📌 Defect Type Breakdown  
- 📌 Test Execution Status Summary  
- 📌 Average Test Duration by Module  

Each metric is visualized using interactive bar and pie charts to help QA teams make data-driven decisions.

|---------------|----------------------------------|
| TestCaseID    | Unique ID of test case           |
| Module        | Module/feature being tested      |
| Status        | Execution result (Pass/Fail)     |
| DefectType    | Type of defect (UI, Backend, etc)|
| Priority      | Priority of defect (High, Medium, Low) |
| AssignedTo    | Assigned tester or developer     |
| ExecutionDate | Date when test was executed      |
